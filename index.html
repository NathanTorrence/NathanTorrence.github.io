          The pages on this website explore the process of mapping the phenomena
          of demand for cycling infrastructure and bikeability (as outlined by
          Winters <i>et al.</i>)<sup>12</sup>, as well as looking at the
          differences between the two metrics. More in-depth explanations of the
          methods used can be found in the

        <h4><strong>Benefits of Cycling</strong></h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Cycling as a recreational and utilitarian mode of transportation is
          becoming more prevalent in Canada due to positive health,
          environmental, and economic benefits<sup>10</sup>. As an active form
          of transportation, cycling contributes to the prevention of several
          chronic diseases, and is associated with a reduced risk of pre-mature
          death<sup>11</sup>. Modelling of transportation mode-shares in
          Adelaide, Australia for example, have estimated that roughly 238,636
          tons of carbon dioxide emissions could be avoided every year in the
          city with a 10% mode-share shift to cycling from vehicular
          travel<sup>13</sup>. As well, cycling as a form of transportation is
          more cost-effective than vehicular or public transportation both in
          costs to the individual user and in the costs of
          infrastructure<sup>9</sup>. Due to the combined adverse effects of
          vehicular transportation on health, safety, the environment, and
          infrastructure costs, research has found that cycling can produce
          substantial economic benefits. In the Netherlands for example, the
          benefits of cycling translate into an estimated return on investment
          of &euro;19 billion per year, equivalent to approximately $26.4
          billion CAD in 2015<sup>3</sup>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <h4><strong>Infrastructure's Role in Cycling Adoption</strong></h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          While cycling has these broad positive effects, special care must be
          taken at municipal and regional levels to ensure the successful
          adoption of cycling as an alternative mode of transportation. Numerous
          studies have concluded that cycling infrastructure, including
          designated bike paths, parking, and bike lanes, is necessary for the
          success of cycling initiatives<sup>1,2,4</sup>. It is important to
          note that low-traffic and residential streets can be considered highly
          suitable for cycling without designated cycling facilities; however
          larger streets which allow for more direct travel are in higher need
          of infrastructure<sup>7</sup>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the cities of Guelph, Ontario<sup>1</sup> and Portland,
          Oregon<sup>2</sup>, research into the role of infrastructure in
          cycling has shown that individuals who cycle as their regular form of
          transportation tend to divert little from major road-routes with bike
          lanes, and that a disproportionate share of cycling occurs on streets
          with cycling infrastructure. It has also been found that when planning
          the expansion of a cycling network in a region, it is most important
          to identify and focus on major routes and destinations where cycling
          is most feasible such as major business and community
          centres<sup>8</sup>.

        <h4>
          <strong>
            Demand and Bikeability - Mapping Cycling and the Built Environment
          </strong>
        </h4>
        <br />
        <p>
          Few methods were found in the literature to represent how the built
          environment and cycling interact across space. Gaps in cycling
          infrastructure have been mapped<sup>5</sup>, though using data such as
          origin-destination matrices and travel behaviour survey data which are
          not available in many cities and regions. Other methods<sup>6,12</sup>
          describe how to map the bikeability of an area, representing how well
          existing cycling facilities and other factors contribute to the
          cyclist experience. Another phenomenon relating cycling to the built
          environment is the demand for cycling facilities in a region. While
          research has been made into factors that contribute to this demand,
          there is a lack of methods in the literature to map this phenomenon
          across space.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This project set out to develop a novel methodology to map demand for
          cycling infrastructure, independent of existing facilities, using data
          that is commonly available. Such a metric can provide usefulness for
          better informing cycling policy and initiatives in the region. Used
          alongside Winters <i>et al.</i>'s bikeability metric<sup>12</sup>, it
          can provide further utility in identifying gaps in cycling
          infrastructure: areas where there is a high discrepancy between how
          bikeable an area is how much demand there is for cycling
          infrastructure.
